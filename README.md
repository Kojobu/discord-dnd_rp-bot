# Gustav the rp-bot
A small bot which allow the user to randomize decision of e.g. a text based rpg based on the established DnD mechanics. 
It features a simple character management as well as a random option for side characters, ability score checks and perhaps even statistics in the future.
Type !helpme for detailed info how to use the bot.

Update: 
I added some funny features like making plots of the local magnetic field. I used a raspberrypi and a BM1422AGMV sensor, see here: https://github.com/Kojobu/magread_BM1422AGMV. It also has some additional features (make plots given one or two arrays, scrap the Ozon value and the mensa meals etc). Just scroll through the super well-structed and well-commented code and find out what he can.

Update-Update:
I revamped Gustav in Go, his name is now Gostav (see https://github.com/Kojobu/gostav). This code will not be updated anymore.
